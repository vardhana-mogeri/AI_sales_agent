Evaluation Strategy Document
1. Overview
This document outlines the evaluation strategy for the AI agent project. The evaluation consists of both offline and online components, designed to ensure quality, reliability, and continual improvement.

2. Offline Evaluation
Metrics
Accuracy: Measure correctness of predicted intents and entities.

Precision, Recall, F1-score: For classification tasks (intent, entity recognition).

Response Appropriateness: Human rating on a scale (1-5) for chatbot responses.

Latency: Time taken for the system to generate a response.

Prompt Testing Approach
Use a benchmark dataset of sample conversations and queries.

Run prompt variants to test for robustness and edge cases.

Analyze LLM output consistency and relevance.

Track prompt performance changes across LLM model updates.

3. Online Evaluation
Metrics
User Satisfaction: Collected via feedback and ratings.

Engagement Metrics: Number of turns per conversation, session length.

Conversion Rate: For sales or lead generation tasks.

Error Rate: Frequency of failed or nonsensical responses.

Real-Time Monitoring
Automated logging of interaction data.

Alerting on performance drops or error spikes.

4. LLM Performance Score Concept
A composite score to summarize LLM effectiveness, combining:

Intent and entity recognition accuracy.

Response quality ratings.

System latency.

User engagement feedback.

Weighted scoring will allow tracking improvement over time and across different models or prompt versions.
